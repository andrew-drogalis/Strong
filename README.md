## Goals

The goal of this project was to improve upon the design of Sturdy and Canary, either by increasing rolls and maintaining redirects or maintaining rolls and decreasing redirects.

Here's a brief summary table of the main statistics for each:

```
                     Strong      Sturdy     Canary
Sfb:                 0.990%      0.935%     0.962%
Dsfb:                6.238%      6.222%     8.057%
Lsb:                 0.607%      2.413%     2.675%

Total Rolls:        48.010%     48.082%    48.537%
Total Redirects:     3.818%      5.399%     7.152%
```

There are other important metrics to consider, such as hand split, scissors, Vim usage, and difficulty to learn from QWERTY â€” all to be discussed below.

## Layout

Here's the keyboard layout with finger heatmap:

#### Hand Split

It's important to have a

```
                 Strong     Sturdy    Canary
Right Hand:      49.43%     55.13%    56.09%
Left Hand:       50.22%     44.52%    43.56%
```

#### Very Low LSB

I

#### High Rolls

#### Low Redirects

#### Low SFB

#### QWERTY and Vim

## Weaknesses

## Terminology

- Bigram: A sequence of two keys (not containing space)
- Trigram: A sequence of three keys (not containing space)
- SFB: Same Finger Bigram; a bigram that requires the same finger for both keys
- DSFB: Disjointed Same Finger Bigram; pressing two keys with the same finger, separated by x letters
- LSB: Lateral Stretch Bigram; a bigram typed with adjacent fingers, but requires a lateral stretch
- Redirect: A trigram which changes direction on the same hand (excluding SFBs)
- Roll: A trigram which changes hands once (excluding SFBs)
- Alternate: A trigram which changes hands twice (excluding SFBs)

## Etymology

The name comes from an anagram of the left hand home row, 'NTRSG' -> 'STRNG'. It was either, Strong, String, Strung, or Strang, so Strong seemed like the best choice!
